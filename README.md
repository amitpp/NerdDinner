Migrating ASP.NET MVC1 NerdDinner Tutorial in ASP.NET Core

Couldn't use google maps yet as I couldn't make "dotnet dev-certs https --trust" work on ubuntu (visual studio code).
Have used dotnet cli for most of work as visual studio code doesn't do a lot of things on its own contrary to Visual Studio
for Mac/Windows as it looks like as per tutorials.
